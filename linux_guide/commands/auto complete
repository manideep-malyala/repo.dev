AUTO COMPLETION

linux provides a feature called auto-completion 
when we want to complete the command with automatic suggestions 
we can use [tab]


------------------------------
[ example ]

# ls /etc/yu        --> press tab to automatically complete the command 

like this we can use the chain of auto completion suggestions to improve the speed of working with linux
and in case if there are more than one suggestion : we have to double tab to get all the available suggestions

# cd /etc/yu        --> double tab to get the multiple suggestion to complete

this feature will be helpful if we forget some file or direc name and we want to see what are all the available options

# cd /etc/          --> double tab
